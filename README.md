# Exponent-ReactNative-Drawer-Navigation
simple and easy template for a drawer in React Native Exponent

TO START:

1)Download Exponent
2)Download Xcode(optional)
3)Open folder with Exponent
  -npm install --save @exponent/ex-navigation react-native react
4)View project with either device simulator or with real device via exponent


I would reccomend starting with the Router, and DrawerNavigationContainer for starters. They contain the real meat of the project and allow the drawer to work properly.
